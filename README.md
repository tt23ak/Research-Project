# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. It employs the dataset from the UCI Repository and includes steps for data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and model training.

## Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Repository
- **Description**: The dataset includes features relevant to breast cancer diagnosis, such as tumor size, texture, and cell nucleus properties. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Import**
   - Download the dataset from the UCI Repository and load it into the environment.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Clean and organize the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Perform statistical and graphical analysis to understand data distribution and feature relationships.

4. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalize and encode features for compatibility with machine learning models.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
   - Evaluate models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

## Results
- The project evaluates and compares the performance of different models to determine the best approach for breast cancer prediction.

## How to Use the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tt23ak/Research-Project
   ```

2. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
